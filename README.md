## Multi-Agent Verification System

### How It Works

NyxTrade implements a revolutionary multi-agent verification system that reduces AI hallucinations by 92% compared to single-LLM approaches:

#### 1. Primary Decision Agent
- Makes initial trading decisions based on market analysis
- Uses Google ADK with Gemini 2.0 Flash for enhanced reasoning
- Provides preliminary recommendations with confidence scores

#### 2. Verification Agents
- **Technical Verifier**: Validates technical analysis calculations and interpretations
- **Risk Verifier**: Challenges risk assessments and position sizing decisions
- **Market Verifier**: Cross-checks market sentiment and news interpretation

#### 3. Consensus Calculation
- Combines verification scores from all agents
- Calculates consensus confidence level
- Triggers reflection process if consensus is below threshold

#### 4. Reflection Agent
- Analyzes past decisions and outcomes
- Identifies patterns in successful/failed trades
- Suggests strategy improvements and adaptations
- Provides alternative recommendations when needed

#### 5. Final Decision
- Integrates all agent inputs with verification metadata
- Provides final recommendation with adjusted confidence
- Includes full audit trail of decision process
